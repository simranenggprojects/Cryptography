# Cryptography
It includes coding of famous ciphers in simplified and generalized manner.
Some popular ciphers in ethical hacking with code in C++

### 1. Caesar Cipher
Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
e.g. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz can be coded as defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc when key = 3 letters down,

Decryption is reverse process of it.
1. Substitution Cipher
2. Symmetric Cipher
3. Stream Cipher
4. Really easy to crack

### 2. Playfair Cipher
The pairs (bigrams) are encrypted with the help of 5x5 playfair matrix.

Decryption is reverse process of it.
1. Substitution Cipher
2. Symmetric Cipher
3. Block Cipher
4. Better than Caesar Cipher

### 3. Hill Cipher
### 4. Rail Fence Cipher
### 5. Row Transposition Cipher
